METRICS:
1. Peak Period Alignment - How well do the peak periods match?
2. Derivative Consistency - How similar are the rates of change?
3. Amplitude Stability - How similar are the value ranges?
4. Tolerance Level - How similar are the variations?
5. Correlation with Target - How well do values correlate?

SCORING FORMULAS:
1. Peak Period Alignment Score = max(0, 1 - |peak_diff| / max_peak) * 1.5
2. Derivative Consistency Score = max(0, 1 - |deriv_diff| / max_deriv) * 1.5  
3. Amplitude Stability Score = max(0, 1 - |range_diff| / max_range) * 1.5
4. Tolerance Level Score = max(0, 1 - |std_diff| / max_std) * 1.5
5. Correlation Score = max(0, correlation_coefficient) * 4.0

CALCULATION STEPS:
- Find peaks in both series (local maxima)
- Calculate derivatives using adjacent differences
- Compute ranges (max - min) and standard deviations
- Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient
- Apply formulas above and sum all scores

TOTAL SCORE = Sum of all 5 component scores (Range: 0-10)
